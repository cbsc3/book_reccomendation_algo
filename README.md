# Plotting Trends Using MatPlot Charts & Arbitrary Data from LLM

In the following picture, here is data showing the trend in genre as the days have passed. Rational number values are assigned to the most popular genres. As the genre's begin to deviate (they are sourced from the google books api), a LLM will add .03. This allows us to quantify genres.

# Why?
I felt as though many book reccomendation systems don't really work and I am building this as avid reader & programmer who needs a dependable system

# Availability

This repo really follows the logistics, I hope to get the web app running soon after writing a POC
 
# Supervision

These are some predicted trends using linear regression, however they will need to be supervised (which I've done with the help of an LLM)
